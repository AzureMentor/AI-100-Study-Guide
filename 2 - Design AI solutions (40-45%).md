# AI-100: Design AI solutions (40-45%)

## Design solutions that include one or more pipelines
- define an AI application workflow process
- design a strategy for ingest and egress data
- design the integration point between multiple workflows and pipelines
- design pipelines that use AI apps
- design pipelines that call Azure Machine Learning models
- select an AI solution that meet cost constraints

## Design solutions that uses Cognitive Services
- design solutions that use vision, speech, language, knowledge, search, and anomaly detection APIs

## Design solutions that implement the Bot Framework
- integrate bots and AI solutions
- design bot services that use Language Understanding (LUIS)
- design bots that integrate with channels
- integrate bots with Azure app services and Azure Application Insights

## Design the compute infrastructure to support a solution
- identify whether to create a GPU, FPGA, or CPU-based solution
- identify whether to use a cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid compute infrastructure
- select a compute solution that meets cost constraints

## Design for data governance, compliance, integrity, and security
- define how users and applications will authenticate to AI services
- design a content moderation strategy for data usage within an AI solution
- ensure that data adheres to compliance requirements defined by your organization
- ensure appropriate governance of data
- design strategies to ensure that the solution meets data privacy regulations and industry standards
