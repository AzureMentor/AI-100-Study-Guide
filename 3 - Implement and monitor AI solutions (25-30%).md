# AI-100: Implement and monitor AI solutions (25-30%)

## Implement an AI workflow
- develop AI pipelines
- manage the flow of data through the solution components
- implement data logging processes
- define and construct interfaces for custom AI services
- create solution endpoints
- develop streaming solutions

## Integrate AI services with solution components
- configure prerequisite components and input datasets to allow the consumption of Cognitive Services APIs
- configure integration with Cognitive Services
- configure prerequisite components to allow connectivity to the Bot Framework
- implement Azure Search in a solution

## Monitor and evaluate the AI environment
- identify the differences between:
    - KPIs
    - reported metrics
    - root causes of the differences
- identify the differences between:
    - expected workflow throughput
    - actual workflow throughput
- maintain an AI solution for continuous improvement
- monitor AI components for availability
- recommend changes to an AI solution based on performance data
